== Deep Reinforcement Learning 

* Pytorch DRL cart-pole example: 
    * Notebook with documentation: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html
    * Source: https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/main/intermediate_source/reinforcement_q_learning.py
    * You might find it helpful to read the original `Deep Q Learning (DQN) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602>`__ paper
    * Clone the pytorch tutorials repo.
    * Run with `ipython3`: `run -i reinforcement_q_learning.py`
