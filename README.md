This repo contains the support elements to run various examples associated with the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html)

## Setup

Set up a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies: [setup_venv.sh](./setup_venv.sh)

## Examples

### Deep Reinforcement Learning

#### PyTorch DRL Cart-Pole Example

Quickstart:
* Clone the pytorch tutorials repo: [https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials]
* Run with `ipython3`: 
    * Change to the directory `tutorials/intermediate_source`
    * Start ipython3
    * `run -i reinforcement_q_learning.py`

Background:
* Notebook with documentation: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html
* Source: https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/main/intermediate_source/reinforcement_q_learning.py
* You might find it helpful to read the original `Deep Q Learning (DQN) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602>`__ paper
